## Assignment 2: Rshell

Rshell is a computer program reads in a command line, then executes them.
It can run commands such as a custom built exit command as well as commands from the std library. 
Our objective for this assignment is to enable our program to handle single commands as well as
multiple commands that are connected by connectors, such as "&&", "||", ";". 
It should also recognize comment command, "#" and ignore anything typed after it for the rest of the line.
